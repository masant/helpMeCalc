helpMeCalc! consists in a webpage that reunite some web applications ables to help engineering students to calculate some problems. In the platform, it is possible return some calculations results and some plots. In this initial version, it is possible to calculate Root Locus, Bode Diagram, Complex Numbers Conversions and Step Response, but, the idea is improve this project as fast as possible.

All the project was build using **Python (Flask), HTML (w/ Jinja2), CSS and some basics of Javascript**. For plotting it was used *matplotlib + mpld3* for root locus and bode; and *bokeh (step response)*. All topics about control theory, I used the (awesome) library *control*, that has a lot of complete solutions for this area.

# Libraries

All the python libraries used in this project can be installed using requirements.txt file. But, I had to do some changes in the functions control.rlocus and control.bode:

control.rlocus

    I had to modify function to return the variable 'f' (plot figure) besides the other variables. Without this modification, I couldn't convert matplotlib plot to html using mpld3.
    I had to change the default plot color to green. (The default color, without this modification, was blue)

control.bode

      I had to modify function to return the variable 'f' (plot figure) besides the other variables. Without this modification, I couldn't convert matplotlib plot to html using mpld3.

In this repository, there is a folder called "control", where all the modifications were done so, before run the project, do not forget to substitute the original control folder with the project control paste. I recomend you to use a virtual environment to do these modifications.

This project have been my **CS50x** 2020 final project, where I could learn a lot about some computer science topics. My objective doing this course was improve my programming skills and I can affirm that I, absolutely, get this goal! I'm way more confortable to program in C, Python, HTML and CSS and, besides, I have learned some Javascript basic topics. But the idea behind CS50 is not teach me a specific programming language but more than this: it teaches me the necessary theory to learn any programming language.

But I have much more to learn, this is just the beginning for more complex knowledges.

This was CS50 for me!
